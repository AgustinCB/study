1. To start, let’s examine a simple program, “loop.s”. First, just look at the program, and see if you can understand it: cat loop.s. Then, run it with these arguments: ./x86.py -p loop.s -t 1 -i 100 -R dx. This specifies a single thread, an interrupt every 100 instructions,  and tracing of register %dx. Can you figure out what the value of %dx will be during the run? Once you have, run the same above and use the -c flag to check your answers; note the answers, on the left, show the value of the register (or memory value) after the instruction on the right has run.

I was able to imagine them relative to the initial value. I wasn't sure at which value the register would start. I suspected zero, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a random number.

```
   dx          Thread 0         
    0   
   -1   1000 sub  $1,%dx
   -1   1001 test $0,%dx
   -1   1002 jgte .top
   -1   1003 hal
```

2. Now run the same code but with these flags: `./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 100 -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx` This specifies two threads, and initializes each %dx register to 3. What values will %dx see? Run with the -c flag to see the answers. Does the presence of multiple threads affect anything about your calculations? Is there a race condition in this code?

There's anything special to keep in mind when calculating, nor race condition. The only trick is to know that every thread's register values are separated and they shouldn't interefer with each other.

    2                            1002 jgte .top
    1                            1000 sub  $1,%dx
    1                            1001 test $0,%dx
    1                            1002 jgte .top
    0                            1000 sub  $1,%dx
    0                            1001 test $0,%dx
    0                            1002 jgte .top
   -1                            1000 sub  $1,%dx
   -1                            1001 test $0,%dx
   -1                            1002 jgte .top
   -1                            1003 halt
```

3. Now run the following: `./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 3 -r -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx` This makes the interrupt interval quite small and random; use different seeds with -s to see different interleavings. Does the frequency of interruption change anything about this program?

Kinda.

   -1                            1003 halt
```

It doesn't change the behaviour of each thread, but it jumps more often from one to another.

4. Next we’ll examine a different program (looping-race-nolock.s). This program accesses a shared variable located at memory address 2000; we’ll call this variable value for simplicity. Run it with a single thread and make sure you understand what it does, like this: `./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 1 -M 2000`. What value is found in value (i.e., at memory address 2000) throughout the run? Use -c to check your answer.


```
 2000          Thread 0         
    0
    0   1000 mov 2000, %ax
    0   1001 add $1, %ax
    1   1002 mov %ax, 2000
    1   1003 sub  $1, %bx
    1   1004 test $0, %bx
    1   1005 jgt .top
    1   1006 halt
```
