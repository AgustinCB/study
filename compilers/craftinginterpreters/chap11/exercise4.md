4.- Our resolver calculates which environment the variable is found in, but itâ€™s still looked up by name in that map. A more efficient environment representation would store local variables in an array and look them up by index.

Extend the resolver to associate a unique index for each local variable declared in a scope. When resolving a variable access, look up both the scope the variable is in and its index and store that. In the interpreter, use that to quickly access a variable by its index instead of using a map.

I ALREADY DID THAT. HAH!
