# Neurons and the brain

Neural networks are algorithms that were created with the idea of having systems that can mimic the brain. We will cover now some of the background behind these ideas.

They were very widely used in the 80s and early 90s, but the popularity diminished in late 90s till very recently when they resurgenced as the state-of-the-art technique for many applications.

One of the reasons why this happened is because they are a ver computational expensive process and only recently computers became fast enough to be able to handle the load.

One of the interesting thing about the brain is the idea of a "one learning algorithm." There's an hyphotesis that it uses the same proccedures to learn how to recognize what we see than to learn mathematics. So instead of having thousands of different specialized pieces of software, you'd have one generalistic idea.
