# Dimensionality reduction: Visualization

We already covered how to use dimensionality reduction to compress data, now we will see how to use to visualise the data. This is important because it will help us develop an intuition on how to interpret the information.

Let's start with an example: Let's say we are collecting a large dataset about different quantitative measures of countries around the globe (for example GDP, GDP per campita, etc).

What can we do to understand the data better? If you have 50 features, is difficult to plot them.

Instead of having each country to represent a fifty dimensional vector, we can try to come up with a representation that uses two or three dimensions so we can plot it.

We may find, for example, that we can think of a country as vector of two values: One representing the overall economy power and another representing the per person commodity.
