# Clustering

In this lesson we will start covering clustering, our first unsupervised learning algorithm.

An unsupervised learning problem is one in which we don't have any label associated to our label (there's no output on the training set) and we want to find some structure in the data. For example, the clustering algorithm will try to cluster the data in a set of groups.

It's useful for market segmentation, social network analysis, organize computing clusters or astronomical data analysis.
