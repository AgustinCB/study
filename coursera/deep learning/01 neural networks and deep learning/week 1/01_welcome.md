# Welcome

Deep learning has already transformed business, but it's also used also in other industries such as medicine or agriculture. In this course we will cover how to build deep learning application.

## AI is the new electricity

Electricity had once transformed countless industries. AI will now bring about an equally big transformation.

## What you'll learn

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning: It will cover the foundations of Deep Learning, including building and training.
