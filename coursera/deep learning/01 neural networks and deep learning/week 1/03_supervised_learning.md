# Supervised learning with neural networks

In this lesson we'll cover the case of supervised learning with neural networks.

In supervised learning you have an input x and you want to get an output y. For example, you have home features and you want to get a price.

In cases like the housing prices or online advertising, we use what is called standard neural networks. In cases like image classification, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN). In cases of sequence data (such as audio or nlp), you use a recurring neural network (RNN). For more complex applications, like autonomous driving, you'd use a custom or hybrid neural network application.

Another important terminology are: Structure data and unstructure data. The first one is when each of the features of your dataset has a very well defined meaning. Unstructure data, in contrast, is when you have features that don't have a meaning by themselves (such as audio, image or text).
