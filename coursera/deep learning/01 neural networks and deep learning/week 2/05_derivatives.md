# Derivatives

In this lesson we will cover some of the intuition behind derivatives.

Suppose we have the function f(a) = 3a. That means that f(2) = 6 and f(2.001) = 6.003. That means that the amount f(a) went up is three times the amount that a went up. That means that the slope (derivative) of f(a) at a=2 is 3. And more generally, the slope is equals to the difference of the height between the the difference of the wigth.

Let's now say that a=5 and therefore f(a)=15. We have then that f(5.001) = 15.003. The slope at five is also three.

We can now generlize this by saying that d(f(a))/da = 3. Which means that by notches a to the right by an infinitesimal amount, then the amount f(a) goes up is 3.

One property of the derivative is that no matter what the value of a is, the slope is the same everywhere.
