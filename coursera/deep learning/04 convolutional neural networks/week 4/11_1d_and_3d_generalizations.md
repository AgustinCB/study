# 1D and 3D generalizations

In this lesson we will see how to apply ConvNet ideas to 1D and 3D data.

We saw how to apply a 2D filter into a 2D input image. A similar idea can be applied to 1D data. Suppose you have an electro-cardiogram and a single wave as a filter. We would do basically the same: Grab our 1-dimensional filter and apply it in lots of different possitions in the input vector to get an output vector.

Similarly works for 3D data.
