# Why look at case studies?

This lesson we will see why look at case studies is important.

- Seeing how someone solved a problem helps you learn about the problem.
- Some of the process can be extrapolated to something else.
- Reading papers is satisfying.

To do so, we will see some classic networks:

- LeNet-5
- AlexNet
- VGG

Then we will see the ResNet, a network that trained 152 layers.

We will also see the Inception neural network.
