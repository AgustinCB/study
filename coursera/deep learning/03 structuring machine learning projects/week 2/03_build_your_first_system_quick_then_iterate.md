# Build your first system quick, then iterate

In this lesson we will explain how to approach building your first system quick and then interate.

In speech recognition there's a lot of techniques that you can try:

- Handle noisy background.
- Handle different accents.
- Handle distance from microphone.
- Handle young children's speech.
- Handle stuttering.

And many other things. This is true for almost any machine learning system. The challenge how to pick which one to optimize.

A good aproach is to quickly set up your dev/test set and your metric and build an initial machine learning system quickly. Then you analyse bias/variance and the error to understand what are the best next steps.

This is isn't true if you work in an area where you have a lot of experience or where there's an strong academic background in which you can rely on.
