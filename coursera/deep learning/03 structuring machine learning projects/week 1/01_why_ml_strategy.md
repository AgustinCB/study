# Why ML strategy?

We will in this course how make machine learning projects work efficiently.

Let's say that you work in a cat classifier and get to have a model that has 90% accuracy. So you have some ideas on how to fix it:

- Collect more data.
- Collect more diverse training set.
- Train the algorithm longer with gradient descent.
- Try Adam.
- Try a bigger network.
- Try a small network.
- Try dropout.
- Add L2 regularization

Choosing the best idea to solve the problem that you have is crucial. This is what this course is about.
