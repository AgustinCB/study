# Why human-level performance?

A lot more machine learning teams have been talking about comparing the performance of machine learning algorith with human-level performance. This is because:

1. Algorithms are becoming so good that they compite with human performance.
2. Algorithms perform better when trying to do soemthing that humans can also do.

Algorithms tend to progress a lot still surpassing human level performance and then go much slower. The performance approaches but never surpasses some limit performance level, called Bayes optimal error. This can be thought as the best possible error.

There're two reasons for that:

1. Human level performance is not that far from the optimal error. There isn't, usually, much head room to improve.
2. The tools to improve performance once you surpass human performance are often harder to use and implement.

So long as ML is worse than humans, you can:

1. Get labeled data from humans.
2. Gain insight from manual error analysis. Why did a person get this right?
3. Better analysis of bias/variance.

Once your algorithm is doing better than humans, this tactics are harder to apply.
