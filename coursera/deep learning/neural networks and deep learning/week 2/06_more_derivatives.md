# More about derivatives

In this lesson we will cover functions where the slope can be different at different points of the function.

Let's start with an example: f(a) = a^2. Then we have f(2) = 4 and f(2.001) = 4.004001. The slope of f(a) at a=2 (or d/da f(a)=4 when a=2) is roughly 4.

We also have f(a)=25 and f(5.001) = 25.010. So now we have that d/da f(a)=10 when a=5. More generally, you can say: d/(da)f(a) = d/(da) a^2 = 2a.
