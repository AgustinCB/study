# Why sequence models

In this lesson we will cover what sequence models can be useful for.

In speech recognition you're given an audio clip x and returns a sequence of words.

Music generation is another example, the input can be an empty set or the gender of music you want and the output is a sequence of notes.

In sentiment classification it's also useful, for example, given a phrase describing a movie, what's the rating?

Same for DNA sequences: DNA is as input and an output to identify a protein.

It also works in things like machine translation, video activity recognition and name entity recognition.
