# Computer vision

In this lesson we will see a high level explanation on how computer vision works.

A computer vision problem can be:

- Image classification (whether it's a picture of a car or not).
- Object detection (draw boxes around specific objects).
- Neural style transfer (You put two pictures together to mix them into a new one).

One of the problems of computer vision is that you often have a lot of features, which requires a lot of space for weigths, bias and network architecture in general. With that many parameters is very hard to get enough data to prevent overfitting.
